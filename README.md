## What is TestBridge?
- TestBridge is our main prototype to our solution in order to enable broswer automation. TestBridge is a user-friendly platform that is designed to make it easier for users to view results from test cases. It offers a comprehensive inteface that showcases results of these test cases through detailed dashboards, interactive data visualizations and summarized data reports. With TestBridge, it provides an easy access to in-depth data analysis so that users can make data-driven decisions to ensure continuous improvement in the overall quality of their application.

## TestBridge's Features:
### Detailed Dashboard:
- A dashboard featuring three data visualizations that display the total number of test cases run and their status.
- These data visualizations offer a better data illustration of the test case results

### View recent test cases:
- Users can view a table which gets populated with test cases with the most recent test cases being documented at the top of the table.

### Customizable Filters and Search:
- Users can filter the test cases by date and status to get specific test cases for a more detailed analysis of the results stored.
